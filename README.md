<h1>Website about the music group <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ProjectMili" target="_blank">'Mili'.</a>.</h1>
<p>The website should be a listener's one-stop shop for any news regarding Mili. It will inform them of any news like song releases and upcoming tours, as well as link them to purchasing officially liscensed merchandise.<br>
It should also act as a repository of all of Mili's previous work so as to attract more work.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<ul>
    <li>News Section to inform viewers about the latest news.It should be nested in the home page so that it is easy to check for updates.</li>
    <li>Merchandise page showcasing all the items available for purchase, grouped neatly into different categories like physical song releases(CD & Vinyl) and physical apparel/accessories.</li>
    <li>Discography page grouped by year. Each song entry should contain an image of the song cover, its name, release date, and any other information like if was a collaboration with a video game or if it's part of an album.</li>
    <li>Tours page should contain 2 sections, 'Current and Upcoming tours', and 'Previous Tours'. Each entry should note where it took place.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Mili's work is quite classical, so a gothic font should be used.</p>
<p>Buttons/containers should have hard corners to match.</p>
